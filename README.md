# Repot-App

### Overview
A React Native app where users can buy &amp; sell their plants. This was a project that I completed to learn the scope and skills needed to understand and implement React Native applications. I truly enjoyed this project from start to finish, but I find myself enjoying desktop and mobile web applications more. 

I learned/improved on:
- Differences between React & React Native
- Mobile assets, events, and libraries
- How to handle user actions in a mobile application
